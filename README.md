# PublicNotes
This repository contains notes suitable for public view.  I use them
to distribute useful documents.  All documents are distributed as
Python 3, Jupyter notebooks because they contain code that may be
useful to other people.  Github should render the pages correctly, but
the hyperlinks in the table of contents of each document (at the top
of each document) will not work until you open the notebook using
Jupyter Notebook.

The directory tree structure is as follows:
  * Programming
      * **Python** - Documents on Python's syntax.  For example,
        Python/PipingAndPostFix.ipynb shows how to introduce postfix
        operator notation.
		* PipingAndPostFix.ipynb - Notes on introducing postfix
          notation in Python
      * **WebAuthentication** - Notes on authentication (for the web
        and otherwise)
		* Basic and Digest Authentication.ipynb - Notes on basic and
          digest authentication.
      * **WebRequests** - Notes of HTTP web requests and web services.
		* Understading HTTP Requests.ipynb - Making and inspecting web
          requests and resposes using `curl`.
