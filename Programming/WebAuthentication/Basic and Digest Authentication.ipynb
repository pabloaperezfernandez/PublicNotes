    "There are a lot of peculiar terms in the digest authentication.  Here the most important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Digest Authentication** - It is what it sounds like.  It is authentication for to digest URIs.\n",
    "2. **Nonce** - A one-time-use string or number\n",
    "3. **Realm** - A string to be displayed to users so they know which username and password to use. This string should contain at least the name of the host performing the authentication and might additionally indicate the collection of users who might have access. An example might be \"registered_users@gotham.news.com\".\n",
    "4. **Domain** - Comma-separated list of of URIs to indicate what URIs accept the same authentication information.  If omitted, the client may assume the protection space consists of all URIs on the responding server.\n",
    "5. **Nonce** - String uniquely-generated by the server for each 401 response.\n",
    "6. **Opaque** - String specified by the server to be returned by the client unchanged in the header of subsequent requests to URIs in the same protection space as the responding URI.\n",
    "7. **Qop** - Directive made available for backward compatibility. Examples of values are 'auth' and 'auth-int'. The chosen value affects the calculation of `response`.\n",
    "8. **Response** - 32 Hex digit string computed by the client and verified by the server.  It is constructed using one-way hashes and is the mechanism employed to avoid the transmission of plaintext credentials.\n",
    "9. **Nonce-count (nc)** - MUST be specified if a qop directive is sent (see above), and MUST NOT be specified if the server did not send a qop directive in the WWW-Authenticate header field.  The nc-value is the hexadecimal count of the number of requests (including the current request) that the client has sent with the nonce value in this request.  For example, in the first request sent in response to a given nonce value, the client sends \"nc=00000001\".  The purpose of this directive is to allow the server to detect request replays by maintaining its own copy of this count - if the same nc-value is seen twice, then the request is a replay.   See the description below of the construction of the request-digest value.\n",
    "10. **Cnonce (client nonce)** - MUST be specified if a qop directive is sent (see above), and MUST NOT be specified if the server did not send a qop directive in the WW W-Authenticate header field.  The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, to provide mutual authentication, and to provide some message integrity protection. See the descriptions below of the calculation of the response- digest and request-digest values."
