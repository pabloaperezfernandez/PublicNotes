# Purpose of Gist
1. To demonstrate how to generate charts using Pandas or matplotlib and then use them easily in a Flask app.
2. To make it easy to view COVID-19 statistics and charts

# Requirements
1. Python 3.xx.  I wrote this on 3.7x but it should work with anything relatively new
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

I believe that (but cannot remember) Numpy and Matplotlib get installed by Pandas due to dependencies.  However, the easiest way to go is to install Anaconda's distribution.  It will install all the basic packages for you.

# Installation
1. Download the other two files in this Gist
2. Place `app.py` in some directory
3. Create a subdirectory called `templates` in the same directory where you saved `app.py`
4. Open you shell to the directory where you saved `app.py`
5. Execute `python app.py`
